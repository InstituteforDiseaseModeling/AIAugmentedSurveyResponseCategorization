# AI Augmented Survey Free Text Response Categorization 

Authors:  Joshua L. Proctor and Roy Burstein

## Context for the AI project:  

This project focuses on extracting insights from free text responses collected in large-scale surveys conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). These free text responses provide qualitative data about human motivation and behavior but are often underutilized due to the complexity and time-intensive nature of analysis. In this particular case, we analyze free text response data collected over multiple years in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) regarding reasons caregivers do not vaccinate their children.

Traditionally, processing and analyzing such data requires extensive human effort, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights in a timely manner. However, with advancements in AI tools, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we can now assist humans in understanding these responses more effectively. This project demonstrates how LLMs can be used to identify common themes, sort responses into topical areas, and categorize them based on pre-established classifications.

The repository contains a set of scripts designed to support this process, enabling more efficient analysis and helping bring valuable insights from this kind of data to light.

## Different AI infused workflows:

### Identifying Topics or Themes within the set of responses

### Categorizing the responses into a set of pre-established categories 

### Dynamically identifying topics using an AI assistant
